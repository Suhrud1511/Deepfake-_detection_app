# Deepfake Detection App

## Overview

This Flask web application is designed to detect deepfake images using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model called MesoNet. Deepfake technology has become increasingly sophisticated, making it challenging to distinguish manipulated images from real ones. This app provides a solution for identifying deepfake images by leveraging machine learning techniques.

## Features

- Upload an image file to the application
- Utilize the pre-trained MesoNet model to predict whether the image is a deepfake or real
- Display the prediction result along with confidence score
- Supports JPEG, PNG, and other common image formats
